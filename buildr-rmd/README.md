> Rmarkdown documents

This image is a biggie. It carries a versioned R with the tidyverse and reticulate. RMarkdown tools are added so that you can build R or Python based documents. To enable the `pagedown::chrome_print` function Google Chrome is installed. Chromium doesn't seem to do the job so it has to be Chrome.
